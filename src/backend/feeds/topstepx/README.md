- **WebSocket User Data**: `wss://api.projectx.com/userhub`

### Key Endpoints
```
Authentication:
POST /auth/token                        # OAuth token exchange

Account Management:
GET  /accounts                          # Get account list
GET  /accounts/{accountId}              # Get account details
GET  /accounts/{accountId}/balances     # Get account balances

Market Data:
GET  /contracts                         # Search contracts
GET  /contracts/{contractId}            # Get contract details
GET  /market/historical                 # Get historical data
WS   /markethub                         # Real-time market data

Trading:
POST /orders                            # Place order

GET  /positions                         # Get positions
POST /positions/{positionId}/close      # Close position
```

## Rate Limits
- **API Calls**: Standard rate limiting (not publicly documented)
- **WebSocket**: Real-time streaming with connection limits
- **Production**: Monitor for rate limit responses

## Security Considerations & Restrictions

### Critical Restrictions
- **Device Requirement**: All activity must originate from personal device
- **No VPS/VPN**: Use of VPS, VPNs, or remote servers is strictly prohibited
- **No Sandbox**: Production environment only, no test/sandbox available
- **Final Trades**: All API trades are final and non-reversible

### Security Best practices
- Store API keys securely using environment variables
- Implement proper token rotation
- Use HTTPS only for REST API calls
- Validate all WebSocket connections

## Critical Features for Implementation

### 1. Funded Account Rules Engine

The system must enforce these common funded account rules:

- **Daily Loss Limits**: Maximum daily loss (e.g., $1,000)
- **Max Drawdown**: Trailing drawdown limit (e.g., $2,000)
- **Position Size Limits**: Maximum contracts per trade (e.g., 3 contracts)
- **Profit Targets**: Account passing thresholds (e.g., $3,000 profit)
- **Consistency Rules**: Minimum trading days and profit consistency

### 2. Real-time Monitoring

- Continuous P&L tracking
- Rule violation detection
- Automatic position flattening on violations
- WebSocket notifications for rule status changes

### 3. Risk Management Integration

The TopstepX connector must integrate with:
- TradingView webhook processing
- Tradovate order execution
- Real-time position monitoring
- Emergency stop-loss mechanisms

## Integration Features

### Real-Time Capabilities
- Live market data streaming (quotes, trades, depth)
- Real-time account updates (orders, positions, balances)
- Connection state management (connected, disconnected, error)

### Trading Operations
- Multiple order types (Market, Limit, Stop, Stop-Limit)
- Order modification and cancellation
- Position management and partial closes
- Trade history and order status tracking

### Account Management
- Multi-account support for funded accounts
- Real-time balance and buying power updates
- Position tracking with P&L calculations
- Risk management integration for funded account rules

## Funded Account Specific Features

### Account Rules Integration
- **Daily Loss Limits**: Automated monitoring of daily drawdown limits
- **Trailing Drawdown**: Track maximum account balance and trailing stops
- **Position Sizing**: Enforce maximum position size limits per contract
- **Risk Management**: Real-time risk checks before order placement

### Performance Tracking
- Daily P&L monitoring
- Account balance progression
- Trading statistics and metrics
- Rule compliance reporting

## Environment Variables
```bash
TOPSTEPX_API_KEY=your_api_key
TOPSTEPX_USERNAME=your_username
TOPSTEPX_ENVIRONMENT=LIVE  # or DEMO
TOPSTEPX_WEBHOOK_SECRET=webhook_secret_for_validation
```

## Integration Status
- ðŸš§ **In Development**: Authentication and API client
- ðŸ“… **Planned**: Market data connector
- ðŸ“… **Planned**: Trading connector with funded account rules
- ðŸ“… **Planned**: Real-time WebSocket streaming
- ðŸ“… **Planned**: Integration with TraderTerminal webhook system

## Implementation Notes

### Funded Account Considerations
- Each funded account has specific risk parameters
- Daily loss limits must be enforced in real-time
- Trailing drawdown monitoring is critical
- Position sizing must respect account rules

### WebSocket Implementation
- SignalR-based WebSocket connections
- Automatic reconnection handling
- Callback system for data handling
- Connection state monitoring

### Error Handling
- API error response parsing
- Network failure recovery
- Rate limit handling
- Connection loss recovery

## Testing Strategy

### Development Testing
- Use personal funded accounts for testing
- Implement comprehensive logging
- Test all order types and scenarios
- Validate risk rule enforcement

### Risk Management Testing
- Test daily loss limit enforcement
- Validate trailing drawdown calculations
- Test position size limits
- Verify real-time risk checks

## Integration Points

### TradingView Webhook Flow
```
TradingView Alert â†’ Webhook Receiver â†’ TopstepX Rules Check â†’ Tradovate Execution
```

### Rule Enforcement Points
1. **Pre-execution**: Check rules before placing orders
2. **Real-time**: Monitor positions during market hours
3. **Post-execution**: Validate trades against account rules
4. **Emergency**: Flatten positions on rule violations
