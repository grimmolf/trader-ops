## 📋 Log File Naming Convention

Each development log follows this naming pattern:
```
YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS_<branch>_<commit>_<objective-slug>.[json|md]
```

Examples:
- `20240120_143022_feature-auth_a1b2c3d4_implement_oauth_flow.json`
- `20240120_143022_feature-auth_a1b2c3d4_implement_oauth_flow.md`

## 🔍 Finding Development Logs

### By Date Range
```bash
# Find logs from last week
find docs/development-logs -name "*.md" -newermt "1 week ago"

# Find logs from specific month
ls docs/development-logs/2024/01-january/
```

### By Feature or Component
```bash
# Find all logs related to TradingView integration
grep -r "tradingview\|TradingView" docs/development-logs/ --include="*.md"

# Look in feature-specific directory
ls docs/development-logs/by-feature/tradingview-integration/
```

### By Development Type
```bash
# Find all bug fix logs
ls docs/development-logs/by-type/bugfixes/

# Find all feature development logs
ls docs/development-logs/by-type/features/
```

### By Git Information
```bash
# Find logs for specific branch
find docs/development-logs -name "*feature-auth*"

# Find logs for specific commit
find docs/development-logs -name "*a1b2c3d4*"
```

## 🛠️ Using Development Logs

### For New Team Members
1. **Read Recent Logs**: Understand current development practices
2. **Study Feature Logs**: Learn how major features were implemented
3. **Review Challenge Patterns**: Understand common obstacles and solutions

### For Code Reviews
1. **Reference Implementation Context**: Understand why code was written
2. **Verify Testing Coverage**: Check if adequate testing was performed
3. **Assess Design Decisions**: Evaluate if documented rationale still applies

### For Debugging
1. **Find Implementation History**: Understand how current code evolved
2. **Identify Related Changes**: Find logs for related functionality
3. **Review Testing Methods**: Understand how features were validated

### For Architecture Decisions
1. **Study Past Decisions**: Learn from previous architectural choices
2. **Identify Patterns**: Find successful architectural patterns
3. **Assess Impact**: Understand long-term implications of decisions

## 🔧 Maintenance

### Regular Cleanup
- Archive logs older than 2 years to separate storage
- Remove duplicate or redundant logs
- Update index files monthly

### Organization Updates
- Create new feature directories as needed
- Update categorization as project evolves
- Maintain cross-references between related logs

### Quality Assurance
- Review log completeness monthly
- Ensure critical development sessions are logged
- Validate that logs contain sufficient detail for reproducibility

## 📚 Templates and Standards

Development log templates are available in `scripts/dev-logging/templates/`:
- `feature-template.json` - For new feature development
- `bugfix-template.json` - For bug fixes and issue resolution
- `refactor-template.json` - For code refactoring and improvements

Each template provides structured prompts to ensure comprehensive information capture.

## 🚀 Automation

The development logging system includes automated git hooks:
- **Pre-commit hook**: Prompts for development log before commit
- **Post-commit hook**: Optional post-commit logging
- **Configuration**: Customizable via `.dev-logging-config`

To set up automated logging:
```bash
./scripts/dev-logging/setup-hooks.sh
```
