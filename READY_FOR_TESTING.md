## Ready to Test: TradingView → TraderTerminal

### 1. Start the System
```bash
# Backend (webhook receiver)
uv run uvicorn src.backend.datahub.server:app --reload --port 8000

# Frontend (optional - for dashboard)
npm run dev:frontend
```

### 2. Test Webhook Reception
```bash
# Test endpoint
curl http://localhost:8000/webhook/test

# Send test alert
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/webhook/tradingview \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "symbol": "AAPL",
    "action": "buy", 
    "quantity": 100,
    "account_group": "paper_simulator",
    "strategy": "test_strategy"
  }'
```

### 3. Set Up TradingView Strategy

1. **Copy strategy** from `docs/TRADINGVIEW_STRATEGY_EXAMPLES.md`
2. **Configure webhook URL**: `http://localhost:8000/webhook/tradingview`
3. **Set account group**: Start with `paper_simulator`
4. **Create alert** with strategy

### 4. Watch It Work!

The complete flow works:
1. **TradingView** → Sends webhook alert
2. **TraderTerminal** → Receives and validates
3. **Paper Trading** → Simulates realistic execution
4. **Dashboard** → Shows real-time results
