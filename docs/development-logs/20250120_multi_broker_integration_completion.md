## Technical Architecture

### Data Flow
```
TradingView Webhooks → DataHub Server → Multi-Broker Routing → Execution
                    ↓
                WebSocket → Frontend → Real-Time Updates
```

### Integration Pattern
```typescript
// Unified API Interface
interface BrokerManager {
  auth: Authentication
  marketData: MarketDataAPI
  trading: TradingAPI  
  account: AccountAPI
}

// Real-Time Data Flow
WebSocket → Composables → Vue Components → User Interface
```
