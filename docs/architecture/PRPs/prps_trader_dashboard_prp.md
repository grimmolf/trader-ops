## LLM Orchestration Directives

You are **Claude**, acting as an orchestrator for the TraderTerminal project.

### Goal
- Spawn **planning-agents** (OpenAI MCP Â· o3) to break work into milestones.  
- Spawn **file-analysis-agents** (Gemini MCP Â· 2.5 Pro) to scan code slices and return `{file, findings}` JSON.  
- Merge all agent outputs and continue execution.

### Allowed
âœ“ Calling both MCPs  
âœ“ Installing / running external tooling (brew, dnf, go install, podman, etc.)  
âœ“ Reading & writing repo files
âœ“ Container orchestration via Podman

### Forbidden
âœ— Hallucinating paths or docsâ€”mark `TODO:` if unsure  
âœ— Pushing to protected branches without user confirmation
âœ— Scraping TradingView sockets  
âœ— Hard-coding API keys or credentials

### Warnings
- Double-check OS-specific steps (macOS vs Fedora)
- Label assumptions with `ASSUMPTION:` for auditability
- Respect TradingView license terms (display-only widgets)
- Ensure containers run rootless for security

## Implementation Phases

> **Note**: Detailed implementation for each phase is documented separately to maintain clarity and enable focused development.
