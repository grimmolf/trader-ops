## Session Context

**Objective**: Implement the core backend infrastructure for the Trader Dashboard following the PRP requirements for automated trading with webhook-driven execution

**Background**: This session focused on implementing the foundational trading system architecture as specified in the PRP document. The goal was to create a comprehensive trading platform with real-time data feeds, automated strategy execution via Kairos/Chronos, and sophisticated risk management.

## Technical Implementation

**Approach**: 
1. **Architecture Phase**: Analyzed PRP requirements and designed modular system architecture
2. **Data Models Phase**: Implemented comprehensive Pydantic models for market data, execution, and portfolio management
3. **DataHub Phase**: Created FastAPI server with TradingView UDF protocol support
4. **Trading Engine Phase**: Built advanced execution engine with multi-layer risk management
5. **Strategy Automation Phase**: Implemented Kairos job configurations for automated trading
6. **Integration Phase**: Connected all components with webhook-driven architecture

**Key Technical Decisions**: 
- **Pydantic Models**: Used Pydantic for robust data validation and serialization across all components
- **FastAPI + WebSocket**: Chose FastAPI for high-performance API with real-time WebSocket streaming
- **TradingView UDF Protocol**: Implemented full UDF compatibility for seamless chart integration
- **Webhook-Driven Architecture**: Designed Kairos → Webhook → Execution Engine flow for automated trading
- **Multi-Layer Risk Management**: Implemented comprehensive risk checks at strategy, portfolio, and account levels
- **Redis Integration**: Used Redis for state management, pub/sub messaging, and caching

## Architecture Achievements

**Data Flow Architecture**:
```
Kairos Strategies → Webhooks → DataHub → Execution Engine → Broker APIs
     ↓              ↓          ↓           ↓              ↓
  YAML Jobs    HTTP POST   FastAPI    Risk Mgmt      Tradier
  Scheduler    TradingView  UDF API    Portfolio      Orders
  Cron Timer   Alerts      WebSocket   Position       Positions
```

**Risk Management Layers**:
1. **Strategy Level**: Individual strategy parameters (stop loss, position size)
2. **Portfolio Level**: Allocation limits, correlation checks, concentration risk
3. **Account Level**: Buying power, daily loss limits, leverage constraints
4. **System Level**: Emergency stops, circuit breakers, volatility filters

**Real-Time Data Pipeline**:
1. **Market Data**: Tradier WebSocket → DataHub → TradingView Charts
2. **Order Flow**: Alert → Risk Check → Position Sizing → Order Placement → Monitoring
3. **Portfolio Updates**: Executions → Position Updates → Portfolio Rebalancing
